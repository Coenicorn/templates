### C templates

These are templates I use for all my C projects.
It isn't in any way guaranteed to be optimal, but I like it.

## IMPORTANT

I use the raylib library a lot, so there are library files included in the `/lib` and `/include` directories respectively.
These are platform-specific and not guaranteed to be updated, so please, if you decide to use this (which I don't really recommend but do what you gotta do),
compile the raylib library (https://github.com/Raysay5/raylib) yourself and replace the library and header files!!!
