## IMPORTANT

I use the raylib library a lot. The makefile in this directory expects there to be a `raylib.h` in `/include` and a `libraylib.a` in `/lib`.

The `.a` file is platform-specific and the header files are not guaranteed to be updated, so please, if you decide to use this (which I don't really recommend but do what you gotta do),
compile the raylib library (https://github.com/Raysay5/raylib) yourself and replace the library and header files!!!
